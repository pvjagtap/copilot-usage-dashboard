/**
 * chatLanguageModelsParser.ts — Pure parser for the user's
 * `<UserDir>/chatLanguageModels.json`.
 *
 * Kept in its own file (zero imports) so the parser can be exercised
 * directly from Node tests without needing a `vscode` stub. The IO/path
 * resolution lives in `modelCatalog.ts/readUserChatLanguageModels()` which
 * calls this function with the file's text.
 *
 * File schema — two distinct shapes carry model ids, and BYOK uses the
 * second one:
 *   [
 *     {
 *       "name":   "Copilot",
 *       "vendor": "copilot",
 *       "settings": { "<modelId>": { ...per-model opts... }, ... }
 *     },
 *     {
 *       "name":   "Azure Foundry Anthropic",
 *       "vendor": "customendpoint",
 *       "apiKey": "${input:chat.lm.secret.-27b7acf0}",
 *       "models": [ { "id": "claude-opus-5", "name": "…", "url": "…" }, … ]
 *     },
 *     ...
 *   ]
 *
 *  • `vendor === "copilot"` means GitHub bills it; anything else
 *    (customendpoint, ollama, lmstudio, anthropic, openai, azure, …) is
 *    third-party / not billed.
 *  • `settings` keys are per-model *option* overrides and are NOT a vendor
 *    declaration. VS Code writes them into the Copilot provider entry for
 *    whichever model is selected in the picker — including BYOK models. A
 *    real config proved it: `gpt-5.6-sol` is declared only under
 *    `vendor: "azure"` yet still has a `reasoningEffort` override under the
 *    Copilot entry's `settings`. So a `settings` key must never be read as
 *    "Copilot serves this id".
 *  • `models[]` is the documented BYOK declaration array (built-in providers
 *    and Custom Endpoint) and is the only authoritative vendor signal in this
 *    file. Ignoring it was why BYOK ids such as `claude-opus-5` were never
 *    recorded as third-party and instead got priced by the rate table's
 *    family fallback as Copilot premium traffic.
 *  • Providers that enumerate models at runtime (Ollama, LM Studio) may have
 *    neither block — those are covered by the `vscode.lm` registry reader in
 *    `modelCatalog.ts`, and otherwise fall through to `isKnownGHCModel()`.
 *
 * See <https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/agent-customization/language-models>
 * ("Model configuration reference").

/**
 * Parse the raw JSON text of `chatLanguageModels.json` and return a map of

 * associations.
 *
 * Rules:
 *  • Only `models[]` declares a vendor. A `settings` key is a per-model
 *    option override that VS Code also writes under the Copilot entry for
 *    BYOK models, so it carries no billability information and is skipped.
 *  • Model ids declared under `vendor === "copilot"` are IGNORED — they're
 *    billable, and the authoritative billing source for them is the CAPI
 *    /models response, not this file.
 *  • If a model id is declared under more than one vendor (e.g. both Copilot
 *    and an Anthropic BYOK key), it's AMBIGUOUS — omit from the map. The
 *    classifier will fall back to the CAPI entry / heuristic.
 *  • Only ids declared under exactly one non-Copilot vendor are recorded.
