# Copilot Usage Dashboard

A VS Code extension that shows token usage, AI Credits, and cost across GitHub Copilot Chat, [Oh My Pi](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi), and [Pi](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi) sessions.

## Install

```
npm install
npm run compile
npx @vscode/vsce package --allow-missing-repository
code --install-extension copilot-usage-dashboard-*.vsix
```

## Open

Command Palette → `Copilot Usage: Open Dashboard`

## Prompt-cache TTL

A cached prompt prefix is re-read at a fraction of the input rate, but providers
expire it after a few minutes of inactivity — and once it lapses the whole
conversation is re-billed in full. On a long agent session that is the
difference between a few credits and a few hundred.

Enable `copilotUsage.cacheTtl.enabled` to get a live countdown of how long each
session's cache stays warm, in the status bar, its tooltip, the sidebar, and the
sessions table. Sessions still generating show `HOT` instead of a countdown.

Lifetimes are per-provider under `copilotUsage.cacheTtl.ttl`. Only Anthropic
documents a TTL (~5 min), so treat the rest as tunable estimates rather than
billing guarantees.

## BYOK provider cost

Requests through your own endpoint — Azure AI Foundry, Anthropic, OpenAI, a
local Ollama — are not billed by GitHub. They appear in the non-billable panel,
where the credit columns show only what the traffic *would* have cost on
Copilot: a figure on no invoice you actually receive.

The **Provider cost** column applies your provider's real per-token rates to the
same traffic and reports USD. It is a different vendor's bill, so it is reported
separately and never added to your AI credits.

Anthropic-family rates ship as defaults at published Claude API prices, which
Anthropic documents as also being the Microsoft Foundry rate card. Override
anything under `copilotUsage.byokPricing`, including `regionMultiplier` for
Azure US Data Zone deployments (`1.1x`; Global Standard is `1.0x`).

Two limits worth knowing:

- A model with **no configured rate shows `—`, never `$0.00`.** An unpriced
  Azure deployment and a genuinely free local model must not look identical.
- The total is a **lower bound.** Anthropic charges `0.1x` for cache reads and
  `1.25x`–`2.0x` for cache writes, but VS Code records one undifferentiated
  `cached` count. Cached tokens are priced as reads;
  `copilotUsage.byokPricing.cacheWriteRatio` shifts the split if your workload
  writes more than it reads.

## Configure

Settings → search `copilotUsage`.
